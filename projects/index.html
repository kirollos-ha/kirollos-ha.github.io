    <h1>Projects</h1>
	Various small and big projects I have worked on

	<h2>Jelly</h2>
	<a href="https://github.com/alonzo-bazaar/jelly-less-proto">
	  jelly-less-proto
	</a>
	<p>
	Jelly (java embeddable lisp interpreter) was an learning project (later turned exam project first, and then thesis) of mine aimed at developing a small scheme implementation.
	It features most of what you&#39d expect from a scripting language and from a lisp, such as first order functions, higher order functions, lexical bindings, and the like.
	<br/>
	It also has a Java foreign function interface, (althoug it's implemented via reflection, so not the most performant ffi out there, but more than enough for a learning project) and a module system based on a subset of r7rs, on top of which jelly also implements a small standard library
	<br/>
	<blockquote>
	  Please note I came up with the name Jelly long before learning there were, it seems <a href="https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jellylanguage">other languages named jelly</a>, and by the time I realized it it was too late.

	<h2>CIRA</h2>
	<a href="https://github.com/kirollos-ha/cira">

	</a>
	<p>
	CIRA (short for "Coreutils In Rust, Again") is a small set of unix coreutil clones written as an excercise in rust.
	<br/>
	So far only cat an wc have been implemented.

	<br/>

	<h2>xml-lisp</h2>
	<a href="https://github.com/alonzo-bazaar/xml-lisp">
	  xml-lisp
	</a>
	<p>
	This was a successful, though short lived, attempt of mine at making an html templating engine that used lisp macros to make code that rendered itself as html.
	</p>
	<br/>

	<h2>my dotfiles</h2>
	<a href="https://github.com/alonzo-bazaar/.emacs.d">
	  dotfiles
	</a>
	<p>
	Insofar as dotfiles can be considered a project
	<br/>
	Which, given the size and complexity of most configuration files o&#39 mine, most likely can
